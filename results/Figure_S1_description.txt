FIGURE S1 — Session-wise correlations of model estimates
====================================================================
File: Figure_S1.csv

Each row represents one animal and one task condition, and reports the
correlation between session number and the modeled estimate of choice
proportion.

Columns:
- animal: Animal identifier.
- selection: Task condition ('static', 'dynamic', or 'pictures').
- r: Partial correlation coefficient between session index and the
     model estimate of choice proportion for that condition.
- CI95%: 95 % confidence interval for the correlation coefficient.
- p-val: Unadjusted p-value of the correlation.
- adj_p: P-value after Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple
         comparisons.
- adj_sig: Boolean flag indicating whether the adjusted p-value is
           below the chosen significance threshold.

Numeric values are rounded to two or four decimal places as appropriate.
