FIGURE 2A — Trials per Session across Animals
====================================================================
File: Figure_2A.csv

Each row corresponds to one animal.

Columns:
- animal: Animal identifier.
- trials/session: Median number of trials per session for that animal.
- total trials: Total number of trials performed across all sessions.
- r: Partial correlation coefficient between trials and session number (controlling for duration).
- p-value: Uncorrected p-value for the partial correlation.
- adj_p: Adjusted p-value after multiple comparison correction (Benjamini–Hochberg).
- adj_sig: Boolean indicating whether the adjusted p-value is significant (True/False).

====================================================================
FIGURE 2B — Trial Times Normalized to Session End
====================================================================
File: Figure_2B.csv

Each row corresponds to one animal.

Columns:
- animal: Animal identifier.
- num_sessions: Number of valid sessions for that animal.
- total_trials: Total number of trials across all its sessions.

These values summarize the data shown in the event plot, where individual trial
times are normalized to the session duration (0–1).

====================================================================
FIGURE 2C — Distribution of Median Trial Times
====================================================================
File: Figure_2C.csv

Each row summarizes descriptive and inferential statistics for the overall dataset.

Columns:
- median_trials_all: Global median of session medians for all animals combined.
- min_median: Minimum of individual animals' median trial times.
- max_median: Maximum of individual animals' median trial times.
- iqr_25 / iqr_50 / iqr_75: First, second (median), and third quartiles of the trials-per-session distribution.
- ttest_stat: Statistic of a one-sample t-test comparing median trial times to 0.5 (centered distribution test).
- ttest_p: Associated p-value of the t-test.
- partial_r: Partial correlation coefficient between trials and sessions (controlling for duration).
- partial_p: Corresponding p-value for that partial correlation.
